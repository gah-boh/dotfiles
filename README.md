dotfiles
========

My dotfiles. Nothing too exciting.

Manual Requirements:
- iterm
- freeCodeCamp iterm theme https://github.com/ryanwhocodes/powerlevel9k-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/freeCodeCamp.itermcolors
- zsh via homebrew (remember to run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`)
- oh-my-zsh
- Spaceship https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt
- Install nerd fonts
- Vundle `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
- Before running `linkFiles.sh` try running `diffZshrc.sh` to see if any new things want to be added from a newer version of oh-my-zsh (if that ever happens)
